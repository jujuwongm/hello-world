Minions Minions have been on this planet far longer than we have. They go by many names. Dave, Carl, Paul, Mike. Oh, that one is Norbert. He's an idiot. They're all different. But they all share the same goal. To serve the most despicable master they could find. BOSS! Boss. Boss. Making their master happy was the tribe's very reason for existence. But that's not to say that they didnâ€™t have other passions. Hey, look. It's a banana. Move over. Hey, I know. It's a banana. Ha-hah-ha. Yum yum. Huh? Finding a Boss was easy. But keeping a Boss... therein lies the rub. Ow. Ow. Owww. Whoa! Oh. Oop. Aw. Oh. Oh. I am... oaf. Aw.
