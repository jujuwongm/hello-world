Minions Minions have been on this planet far longer than we have. They go by many names. Dave, Carl, Paul, Mike. Oh, that one is Norbert. He's an idiot. They're all different. But they all share the same goal. To serve the most despicable master they could find. BOSS! Boss. Boss. Making their master happy was the tribe's very reason for existence. But that's not to say that they didnâ€™t have other passions. Hey, look. It's a banana. Move over. Hey, I know. It's a banana. Ha-hah-ha. Yum yum. Huh? Finding a Boss was easy. But keeping a Boss... therein lies the rub. Ow. Ow. Owww. Whoa! Oh. Oop. Aw. Oh. Oh. I am... oaf. Aw. Nope, it wasn't easy for these guys. But they never gave up. With the emergence of the stone age came the rise of a new species. Man was very different from the dinosaur. He was shorter, hairier and way, way smarter. The minions took an instant liking to Man and helped him as best they could. Oh, no no... Here. A present. This? Yes yes yes. For hitting. Ut-ut. Aw! Poor man. So trusting, so fragile, so-so delicious. Their quest for a boss put the minions front and center for some of the civilization most historic moments. Ancient Egypt held great promise. Okay! But it didn't last long. Hmm. Oh. Here. Yup. Ow! The dark ages were actually fun times. Their new master had a tendency to party all night and sleep all day. Ahem. Yoo-hoo. [Happy Birthday] 357 Oh. But eventually the party was over.
